Predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 86% accuracy.

This project leverages ANNs to identify customers who are likely to leave a company, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies.

#Project Overview
	•	Objective: Predict customer churn based on structured data such as demographics, account details, and service usage patterns.
	•	Outcome: Achieved 86% accuracy in identifying potential churners.

#Methodology
	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Encoded categorical variables
	•	Scaled numerical features
	2.	Model Architecture:
	•	Multi-layer ANN
	•	Hidden layers: ReLU activation
	•	Output layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification
	3.	Training & Evaluation:
	•	Trained on historical customer data
	•	Evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
 
#Use Cases
	•	Telecom, banking, and subscription-based businesses can identify at-risk customers.
	•	Helps marketing teams target retention campaigns effectively.
	•	Supports business decisions to reduce churn and increase revenue.

#Technologies Used
	•	Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
	•	TensorFlow / Keras for ANN
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
